# Molar-Mass-Calculator
This little website is in it's initial stages of development.
Created by beginning programmer Jack Irvine, 
I am looking to make it as good as possible, 

So far, issues include:
*Not getting the symbol onto the page.
*Lack of simplicity

Any positive adaptions to this project will be strongly welcomed.
So take the project, 
fiddle with it, 
remember to add comments
and keep things as simple as possible.

Thanks,
Jack
